				About us
			</h1>
			We are a team of 5 aspirational students looking to break the boundaries and limitations of attending concerts.
			<br>
			We call our project « Transcend » as we are meaning to break through the physical boundaries in attending events physically, which may be saving venue space, transportation costs and above all … <strong>MONEY</strong>.
			<br>
			How many concerts have you dreamed of going to but were never able to attend because it was too far or too expensive ? We’re here to remedy this problem through our groundbreaking Virtual Reality technology.
